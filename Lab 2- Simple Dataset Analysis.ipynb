    "In this lab, I worked with a data set surrounding the democrats involved in the primary elections this year around our country. Throughout the lab, I worked to answer a few questions. How many candidates were running for governor? What about the U.S. House of Representatives? How many identified as LGBTQ, non-white, or were veterans? How many were Obama Alum? How many of these democratic candidates advanced to the general election? How many lost their races?"

    "My data is all from FiveThirtyEight: a well known, reputable website founded by Nate Silver that focuses on data analysis, specifically poll analysis. The data set contains information from all open democratic primary elections through August 7th of 2018. The data set contains information on the 811 democratic candidates who ran for various positions up until the 7th. The specific data set I used contained 812 lines of data, and was extremely well organized. One downside of the data-set was that some information surrounding party support, Emily endorsed, gun sense, Biden endorsed, and more were missing or partially filled out. The table was not fully complete. However, the data was well organized, accurate, and the GitHub description contained information on where each number, fact, or name was pulled from."

Unlike lab one, where I created a for loop to append them all to lists by row, here I am making a literal list of lists by row. This will make it extremley easy to pull information from a specific candidate, as I do not have to search for an index as I did in Lab 1, but can pull from my \"list of lists.\" \n",

    "Overall, I learned alot from the data set and analysis at hand. Out of the 811 democratic candidates that this data set covered, around 12% of them ran for governor, while around 84% ran for U.S. House of Representatives. The majority of candidates lost thier race, but the winning democrat moves onto the general election- as the 265 advancing are the democratic candidate in the general. 4.6% of candidates are LGBTQ, and 25% of them do not identify as white. About 15% of candidates who ran are veterans. A large amount of democratic candidates ran for office this year, as more candidates lost than one (as they were racing against eachother). This should mean a good turnout of voters and support for the general, as the democratic winner was narrowed against a tougher competition with more candidates. This large show of democratic candidates suggests a strong support for democrats in November, but could also lead to a split vote as more candidates ran and a greater variety were supported. In addition, this year a fair amount of LGBTQ, non-white, and veterans ran for office, making for a more diverse and different group of candidates. "
